|tcm_full_name| provides a web interface for clusters that run within `Tarantool Clusters Federation <https://www.tarantool.io/en/clustersfederation/>`__.
It is available on the **Cluster** > **TCF** page. If a connected cluster is
configured to run in a TCF installation, this page shows information about both
clusters in this installation: their ID's, names, and statuses. To switch cluster
states in TCF, click **Toggle** on the **TCF** page.

To learn more about Tarantool Clusters Federation, see `its documentation <https://www.tarantool.io/en/clustersfederation/doc/latest/>`__.

.. note::

    For individual clusters, the **TCF** page is empty.
